# Objective

1. Reduce user friction by:
    - Avoiding the command Palette.
    - Applying templates automatically.
    - Move files to folders automatically.
    - Avoiding the need to write metadata manually.
    - Setting Parent Note Automatically.
    - Easy to understand work flows.
    - Display information Visually
    
2. All notes are Linked to at least its parent Note. 

3. Avoid using obsidian File Structure View  ( I don't like it)

# Personal Rules

- **Don’t just copy-paste** — read, reflect, and synthesize.
- **No link-only notes** —  always add context.
- **Don’t capture the obvious** — if it's easily Googleable, skip it.
- **Use clear, unique titles** — no duplicate or vague note names.

# How to use

- Press the **[+] button** on any note to create a **child note**.
- The **Index button** creates an **Area note**.
- An **Area note** button creates a **Theme note**.
- A **Theme note** button creates a **Note**.
- A **Note** button creates a **Child Note**, and so on — allowing infinite depth.
