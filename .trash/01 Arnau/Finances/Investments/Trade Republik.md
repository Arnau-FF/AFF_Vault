>Einlagensicherung refers to deposit insurance. In Germany, bank deposits up to 100,000 euros per customer per bank are protected by the deposit insurance scheme if the bank becomes insolvent. This means customers would get back up to 100,000 euros of their money even if the bank goes bankrupt. But not more that that.
>
>Anlegerentschädigung refers to investor compensation. This covers up to 20,000 euros per customer per bank in the event of loss due to bad investment advice, misselling of financial products, or if assets are misappropriated. So if an investor suffers losses because of misconduct or negligence by the bank, they can claim compensation of up to 20,000 euros from the investor compensation scheme.
>
>Examples for 20k compensation:
>
>- The bank or the broker makes trades without customer authorization or knowledge, resulting in losses. The unauthorized trading would be covered.
 >   
>- A bank mismanages funds by making excessively risky investments inconsistent with the agreed investment mandate.
 >   
>- A bank goes bankrupt and is unable to return securities or assets held in accounts back to investors.
