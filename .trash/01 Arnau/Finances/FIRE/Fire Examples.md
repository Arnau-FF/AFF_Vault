[Es posible Fire en EspaÃ±a con 300k? : r/SpainFIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainFIRE/comments/1h0y70t/es_posible_fire_en_espa%C3%B1a_con_300k/?share_id=Qj0DbouTICYiId5PK0LCL&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=3)

300ke no pero una cartera de 500ke sÃ­.

Soy un francÃ©s que vive en Valencia con mi cartera IBKR de 500k, 2k/mes de dividendos, bajo coste de vida, reinvierto 1000â‚¬/mes. ComprÃ© mi piso en Paiporta al contado a finales de 2022.

Mis ETFs son JEPi JEPG LGEN Abbvie JNJ Microsoft Amazon RIO PEMEX bunds Exopet Bund Carnaval corp bond DIVO IDVO SCHD RFI RQI UTF UTG BGR BST BME BATS MO IUKD HFEL AWF AWP IFN AI ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· $BABA $BIDU JEPG.L USD dist....

He pagado el IRPF en 2024 por la primera vez en EspaÃ±a, 24ke/year divididos, 16% effective tax rate ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ (por quÃ© solo 16% ? Por quÃ© en comunidad valenciana, los primeros 6200â‚¬/aÃ±o estÃ¡n exentos si no tiene otras fuentes de ingresos).

Costa de vida en EspaÃ±a es baja.

SÃ³lo para vivir en Francia, me costaba el doble, 2ke/mes ... 40% IRPF ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, IBI Marsella 2000â‚¬/aÃ±o.... No se puede vivir en este puta paÃ­s de mierda.

[Todo dentro en el SP500 y retirar el 3,5% anual (0,29% mensual) - Â¿Hay algo mejor? : r/EuropeFIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeFIRE/comments/1hnj9jp/all_in_on_sp500_and_withdraw_35_yearly_029/)
```
Im considering retiring in Spain as a tax resident in Spain with 2 million â‚¬. What I have concluded is that simply going all in on SP500 and withdrawing around 3.5% yearly (that is, 0,29% monthly) should be the best strategy.

-You continue to grow your portfolio which is a better peace of mind than having less volatility at the expense of consuming your portfolio (bonds screw you up long term because they underperform, see this chart)

[https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/12/14/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-2-capital-preservation-vs-capital-depletion/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2016/12/14/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-2-capital-preservation-vs-capital-depletion/)

-You don't get your principal diluted as you do with high yield stocks or ETFs like JEPI (what is the point of an high yield when the price per share is just melting long term or cannot even keep up with inflation)

-You get better diversification than a dividend stock portfolio and less complex. Also less risk since there are no derivatives of strategies with options like JEPI, JEPQ etc.

-Volatility is vitality. Just go throught it. That is just a tradeoff for future gains. The money you withdraw will be bigger long term from that 0,29% monthly because it has better returns than "less risky" alternatives.

-Less hassle when dealing with taxes and stuff specially if you are from EU compared with recieving dividends. If I recieve dividends in EU, I have to file the W8BEN to attempt to get the 15% that the IRS keeps back, and they still keep another non-retornable 15%, meaning that you lose always 15% on each dividend payment. What happens is that they keep a 30%, but due this treaty you can get back a 15%, but you always lose this 15%. With the accumulation fund they only charge them 15%, so you don't need to worry about filing these extra steps, and also waiting until next year to get this 15% once you have filed your taxes. (Edit: I think, im not sure, that if the ETF is synthetic instead of physical they charge them 0% for both accumulation and distribution funds, however im not sure about this or the risks involved in having your entire portfolio sitting on synthetic-based ETFs)

-Monthly payments: You just withdraw what you need monthly. If you need less thant this 0.29% then great. If you need more, then you need to have more money to retire. The idea is that you have enough money that a big SP500 drawdown wouldn't put you in trouble. I think this is the ultimate FIRE test.

So that's about it. I don't understand why people overcomplicate things, specially those people with a bunch of dividend stocks when they aren't even profesionals and you would need a full time job to keep track of everything. Just withdraw from SP500 and chill.

Please explain the logic of why there would be a better alternative.
