# Body:

Bitcoin has historically followed consistent 4-year cycles tied to halving events. Here’s the data to consider:

Past Cycles

2012–2016

• Halving to Peak: 371 days (~1 year) • Peak to Bottom: 406 days (~1.1 years) • Bottom to Halving: 543 days (~1.5 years) 

2016–2020

• Halving to Peak: 525 days (~1.5 years) • Peak to Bottom: 364 days (~1 year) • Bottom to Halving: 518 days (~1.5 years) 

2020–2024

• Halving to Peak: 532 days (~1.5 years) • Peak to Bottom: 371 days (~1 year) • Bottom to Halving: 532 days (~1.5 years) 

Projections for 2024–2028

Based on the next halving in April 2024:

• Peak: September–October 2025 (~$150,000–$200,000). • Bottom: September–November 2026, with a correction of 77–85% from the peak. 

If Bitcoin peaks at $180,000:

• 77% correction: ~$41,400 • 80% correction: ~$36,00 • 85% correction: ~$27,000 

Strategy

• Take Profits: Selling in early September 2025 aligns with past peaks. • Re-Enter: Accumulating in late 2026–early 2027 (near the bottom) could maximize gains in the next uptrend. 

Long-Term Holding

If you’re a “HODL forever” type, that works too. Bitcoin’s long-term trend has been exponential, and with growing adoption, ETFs, and institutional interest, future cycles may stabilize while still delivering strong returns.

This historical data supports both active and passive strategies. It all depends on how you want to play the cycle!
