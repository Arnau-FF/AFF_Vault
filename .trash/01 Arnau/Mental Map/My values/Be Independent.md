# Relation Ships: 
## [[Love]]:
Hard Subject, i have loved and i know i can love, and i want too feel loved but at the same time i don't want to depend on that feeling. 

How can i love and feel loved without giving control of my happiness to some one else. 

This is my dilemma , that i need to work on.


## Friendship:
I want to have and enjoy having friends and taking / bee with them, but a the the same time do not depend on that feeling. Hard to balance and not feel [[Loneiness]]
