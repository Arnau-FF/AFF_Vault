# Body:

Author :: [[Art spigelman]]
#### Resume:
It's a comic, Jews are represented by Rats,Polish citizens by pigs and Germans by Cats. 

The book is a resume of what the father of the author had gone through in the second world war as a rich Polish Jew. And is sequels after it finished.  

The main Focus of the Book is the Constant and slow undermining of the quality of live and rights of the Jewish Population.  Pointing out that with [[Constant Small changes]] People did not rebel or presented opposition. 

Starting from taking owner ship of their factories and shops, then only giving them food through food stamps.  Stealing Furniture, arresting them without motive, taking is elders (over 70) to better places (Auschwitz). Separating the non work able people and numerous families from the work able. 
Later all Jews are  enclosed in areas where they only can leave for work. Sooner they cant leave and then they are forced to been redistributed in other work camps.  Our main character decides is better to hide between the polish Population, in stables, basements, closets and garbage. To been in Auschwitz with infra human conditions of food clothing and work, knowing abut the death of their comrades and not putting resistance.


The second main topic of the book is the [[Human Resilience]] physical and psychological.
From working on cold environments to the hunger, sickness (tifus). And on the Physiological side  knowing you aren't going to see your family again, been persecuted, knowing you are going to die, been around death, separated of your wife , and how one letter from her hives you strength. Walking on bodies to go to the bathroom, been enclosed on a train wagon for a week, with no food or water, only snow, while your comrades die at your feet. 


One topic its also touched on is the [[Betrayal]] at different levels. 
- Direct betrayal, Germans, that hate you and have laws against you Steal, beat and lie to you. the phrase never trust a German is repeated on the book several times. 
- Indirect, People that don't have anything against you particularly betray you for their own gain ( see the Hungarians on the border)
- Subsistence betrayal. People in the same position as you betray you in order to slightly improve their living situation or their survival. ( Jew police ,Jew work masters, stealing food and clothes on Auschwitz )


The Book communicates that the survival of the main character was given by luck in the more critical moments, but on the long run was due to his will for surviving and protecting his wife and his resourcefulness. ( knowing basic work skills, people skills and cleverness)

All the story is wounded up in an [[Inception]] layer where the Writer depicts himself interviewing his father years later. In order to convey its sequels and traumas left on him and to bee as transparent and true to the truth as possible and not portray his father as a hero or a victim.
