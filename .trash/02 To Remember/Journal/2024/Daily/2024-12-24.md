# Key Notes:

Very productive day, whent walking in the mornign and made a video for Carles, i am  very proud of it and how easy it was for me to film

I cut some jamon and i liked it.

I got irritated at night at dinner, dad was dirty , very riggid and cuÃ±ao. i managed to stain my new shirt and got annoyed. Mom comed to check on me and it was very anoyed and did not talk properly to her.
