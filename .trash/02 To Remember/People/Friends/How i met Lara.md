# Body:
We met each other on the Line for the Plane to Buenos Aires, Argentina on Late January 2022.

She started to speak to me about the space on the Line. We talked about my work, travel experiences and Argentina. 
When was announced that the Plane was going to be delayed we passed the time together, she bought me some chips. ( So nice )

On our Arrival we were separated by costumes, but found each other waiting for our bags, she waved at me from afar, made me feel, Cared for, Wanted?.

we met  at the bag conveyor and i offered to take her home by car.
