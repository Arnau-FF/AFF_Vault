# Body:
I think i should have said something sooner, so much sooner, but it still was painful to thibk about, and to manage, i arent fully ok yet i am better though. Working on my shit.  

I hope you are doing great with your studies and personl life, and also in finland due to the current events.   

I still have a lot to work on, but i feel more aligned with my life, work , and objectives.  I realised that there are a lot of issues with my self and that will not change with jobs or new people, and that i need to takle them no mater what. 

I feel so sorry for you, i havent been fair with you, not a bit. And you where an Angel for still been with me and holding me, trying to help and supporting me. I feel horrible, partly for not acknowledging it sooner and by the mere fact of doing it . Its not me. 

 Only thinking about it makes me sad and hurts me, that's why I took my time . 

I am not sure how I can repair the damage done or how to revive our friendship, time will tell I gess. 



For now I just want to apologise as sincerely as I can from the deeper of my soul. I am so sorry. For not taking time for you, and getting to now you deeply, and ignoring your attempts at those, not trying harder to remember important thing for you, bombarding you with my infinite amount of problems and worries and various shity  thoughts, and then ignoring your answers, and doing whatever I wanted . For that and much more. 

  

I don't know when I started to get into that negative spiral, or what triggered it, but it isn't and exucuse. 

  

Thanks, and sorry for everything.

  

You are an Angel that saved me more than once, and deserves the best on life.

  

I think you already kinda forgave me, but I would understand if it was not the case.
