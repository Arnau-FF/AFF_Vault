# Relationship :
 11/23 to 21/12/24 ➔ She was not comfortable, lack of things in common. First time shw was on a relation ship, i don't think it was what she was looking for, did not open up as much and did not have serious talks about a lot of stuff  
# Things to learn from:
 Normalize sex, sexuality and talking about sex. 
 Be independent.
